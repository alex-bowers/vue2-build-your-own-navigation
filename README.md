# Build Your Own Navigation

This is a proof of concept project.

I had a few hours available to show how non-developers could have more control over a website's navigation menu. By customising components that developers build.

In production, there would be an API which stores the Builder data and then an endpoint to fill the Result section.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```
